# IMDb Watchlist Manager v3

Automating the rating and deletion of movies from the IMDb watchlist.

## Changes

Added new functionality.

You don't have to download the watchlist, the app now does it for you.

## Requirements
#### Packages:

```selenium```

#### Webdriver:

Download Chrome webdriver (**preferred**) from [this link](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)

Or download Mozilla Geckodriver from [this link](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases)

Then place the downloaded file inside your Python Scripts folder (e.g. C:\Python\Python37\Scripts)

Make sure to add "Scripts" folder to ```PATH``` so it can load properly
